//Onclick function that starts the quiz



//Once quiz starts, User prompted with the question and followed with 4 buttons
    
    //The four buttons generated must have some sort of data value to it


    /*When the user clicks on a button, must take an if statement to check if the two strings are the same.
      meaning they are correct and to let the user know they got it correct insert a new div saying, "You are correct!". 
      If the two strings are incorrect use the same div as correct but replace it with it saying,"You are incorrect, try again!"*/

    /*When the user chooses the correct answer they move onto the next question. That is when the for loop would come in. Or say
      if the user has not clicked */
